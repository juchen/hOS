# Working on classes ``CharRingBuf`` and ``BufferredComOut``.
# Writing in the file 'test_comport.cpp'.
# Following step: write CMakeLists.txt to compile the test code.
# ``ComportLock()`` and ``ComportUnLock()`` need to think more.

The road map is now:
    
    # Red black tree.
    # malloc
    # code refactor. Going to make a ``class Kernel`` and ``class Machine`` to
      contain architecture independent/dependent parts respective, instead of
      putting codes randomly in ``pm_c_entry()``.
